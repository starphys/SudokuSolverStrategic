Stream of consciousness:

To solve a sudoku puzzle we must first develop a concept of a sudoku puzzle:

Each board is made up of squares that form 3 groups: rows, columns, boxes.
	Board size may be 9x9, 16x16, etc.
	Assume 9x9 for first pass.
The board is the collection of all squares
Each square must have a unique identity that places it in context with other squares. Use x,y coordinates for first pass.
Each square must have a concept of the groups that its in, so it can check (and only check) the appropriate row, column, and box.
	This can just be a collection of squares identified for each square as part of constructing the board.
Each square must hold an integer between 0 and 9
	Initialized to contain a clue or 0.
Board will be initialized from file for clues, eventually generate boards using these same algorithms.

Once we have a puzzle, we can begin solving that puzzle:

The solver fills in empty squares with correct values, cannot change clues.
The solver maintains a concept of what could go in a square.
Solver uses established human strategies independently of one another to measure difficulty. 
	Start with naked singles.
	Add basic backtracking

Once we can solve all puzzles, we can generate puzzles and prove their validity:
